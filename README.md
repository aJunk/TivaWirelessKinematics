# TivaWirelessKinematics

With this university project the aim is to build up experience in working with the Tiva-C-Launchpads, made by Texas instruments.
Students were supplied with tiva arm cortex m-series development boards and "click" extension modules (www.mikroe.com).

The goal is to take input using a capacitive touch sensor and use that to drive 2 stepper motors. Input and output should each be performed on a seperate board which are networked using FM-click modules. The two stepper motors are to be arranged as a Core-XY kinematic.
In the end, the whole system should be able to let the user manually move the carriage using the capsense-interface, save positions and then autonomously cycle through these positions.
